          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is Duc Tran. I am a web developer with expertise in HTML and CSS. I enjoy building websites that are both functional and visually appealing. In addition to my technical skills, I am also fluent in two languages, which has given me a unique perspective on different cultures and helped me connect with people from all over the world. When I'm not coding, I love to spend time outdoors and take care of plants. I have a keen interest in gardening and have acquired knowledge on how to care for different types of plants. Travelling is also a passion of mine, and I enjoy exploring new places and experiencing different cultures. Overall, I am a well-rounded individual with a diverse range of interests and skills.</p>

          <p>I am currently employed at Home Depot, where I work in the Garden department. As a member of this department, I have gained hands-on experience and developed a minimal skill set in taking care of various types of plants, flowers, and trees. My daily tasks include watering, pruning, and fertilizing plants, as well as assisting customers with their gardening needs. Additionally, I have learned about the different types of soils, mulches, and gardening tools that are available to customers. Through my work at Home Depot, I have gained a deeper appreciation for the natural world and the importance of maintaining healthy, beautiful green spaces in our communities.</p>
